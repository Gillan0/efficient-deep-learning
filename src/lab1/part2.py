## number of target samples for the final dataset
num_train_examples = len(c10train)
num_samples_subset = 15000

## We set a seed manually so as to reproduce the results easily
seed  = 2147483647

## Generate a list of shuffled indices ; with the fixed seed, the permutation will always be the same, for reproducibility
indices = list(range(num_train_examples))
np.random.RandomState(seed=seed).shuffle(indices)## modifies the list in place

## We define the Subset using the generated indices
c10train_subset = torch.utils.data.Subset(c10train,indices[:num_samples_subset])
print(f"Initial CIFAR10 dataset has {len(c10train)} samples")
print(f"Subset of CIFAR10 dataset has {len(c10train_subset)} samples")

# Finally we can define anoter dataloader for the training data
trainloader_subset = DataLoader(c10train_subset,batch_size=32,shuffle=True)
### You can now use either trainloader (full CIFAR10) or trainloader_subset (subset of CIFAR10) to train your networks.
